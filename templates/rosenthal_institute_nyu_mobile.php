        In November 2002, New York University (NYU) officially</br>
        dedicated the Rosenthal Institute for Aesthetic Dentistry in</br>
        honor of Dr. Larry Rosenthal, a graduate of the NYU College of</br>
        Dentistry and an internationally renowned pioneer in his field.</br>
        The Rosenthal Institute is the nation’s first university-based</br>
        program wholly dedicated to fostering continuing education,</br>
        research, and patient care in current and emerging techniques</br>
        in aesthetic dentistry.</br></br>

        The Rosenthal Institute also houses the NYU College of</br>
        Dentistry’s continuing education program, which attracts</br>
        more than 4,000 dentists from more than 20 countries</br>
        annually, making it the most far-reaching program of its kind</br> 
        in the world.</br> </br>   

        The Rosenthal Institute has worldwide affiliations as well as</br>
        those within its own neighborhood. One of it’s most important</br>
        features is that it enables needy patients to receive aesthetic</br>
        dental procedures at a reduced cost.
