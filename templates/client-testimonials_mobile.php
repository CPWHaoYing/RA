		    Hey Dr. Apa!</br>
	        I just wanted to write to you and tell you how much I LOVE</br>
	        my teeth! I can’t thank you enough for the amazing job you</br>
	        did! I didn’t get a chance to tell you in the office, and I know</br>
	        you are super busy, so I didn’t want to bother you when I left,</br>
	        but I wanted to take the time to write to you, and tell you how</br>
	        ecstatic I am with my new smile! It has made all the difference</br>
	        in the world, and my smile looks so natural! No one would ever</br>
	        think I have veneers, they would just assume I have gorgeous</br>
	        teeth! You really are an artist, and you are the best at what</br>
	        you do. I am so grateful that you were the one that worked on</br>
	        my teeth, and I can’t wait to come in and get the bottom done!</br>
	        Also, thank you so much for giving me a discount, it really</br>
	        means a lot to me, and it’s a big deal. I look forward to seeing</br>
	        you soon, and I hope that the girls in the office saved you a</br>
	        cupcake or two! Thanks again so much!

		    Dear Dr. Apa,</br>
            Thank you so much for seeing me on Wednesday. I can’t even</br>
            begin to tell you what this means to me. When I was a medical</br>
            student, I went for emergent dental work with a female</br>
            dentist who was also one of the professors at the dental</br>
            school. During my root canal, she said to me, “Omigod! You are</br>
            supposed to be a professional. How can you let this happen,</br>
            having such poor dentition?” That has really stuck with me</br>
            over the years. Certainly, I didn’t intend for this to happen,</br>
            but going through med school with children, having married</br>
            at seventeen…you have to make certain sacrifices. When you</br>
            mentioned that factors like these are why you haven’t had</br>
            children, etc…you were so right! It is a struggle. I am finally</br>
            getting to a point where I can venture to think about doing</br>
            this for myself and I am BEYOND excited! I can’t even imagine</br>
            smiling without feeling like I have this horrible “missing</br>
            teeth” jawline. (You know, the whole…”you can take the girl</br>
            out of the trailer park, but you can’t…” look).</br></br>

            I so enjoyed meeting you and immediately felt at ease. I</br>
            appreciate your non-judgmental attitude. That means so much</br>
            to me. I was very nervous making such a big expensive trip for</br>
            a dental visit thinking, “Man, what if this guy is some pompous</br>
            ass that makes me feel horrible?” Unfortunately, many of the</br>
            dental students I remember were the silver spoon crowd. But</br>
            you made me feel at ease, and I appreciate that.</br></br>

            Oh, interestingly, we went to the 3 Guys Cafe for lunch and</br>
            one of the waiters saw my envelope from the office and asked,</br>
            “Hey you goin to see Larry? Or Mike?” I said I was going to see</br>
            you and he said that you did his wife’s smile. He showed me a</br>
            beautiful wedding photo of the two of them on his Palm Pre</br>
            and was so pleased with everything. I thought that was a great</br>
            compliment. I am working out all of the details to try to get</br>
            my work planned as soon as I can. I am so incredibly excited,</br>
            you have no idea! Thank you so much, for everything! I will</br>
            hopefully see you soon.

		    Dear Dr. Rosenthal and Dr. Apa,</br>
            I would like to let you know how much I enjoyed my latest</br>
            experience with you and your team (except, of course, for</br>
            those 12 hours of post bonding!) As usual, everyone was</br>
            professional, pleasant and attentive. I may not be a celebrity,</br>
            but I felt like a “VIP” anyway! I love my new smile! Thank you</br>
            for helping me achieve it.

	    <div class="content">
		    Dear Dr. Rosenthal, Dr. Apa and the lovely ladies who</br>
		    comprise your staff,</br>
            Another testimonial! I couldn’t be any more pleased, even if</br>
            my new smile was gracing the cover of a magazine.</br></br>
            
            This was not an easy decision for me to undertake. Indeed,</br>
            it took close to four years for me to find the time and the</br>
            courage. But the results are wonderful and I have no doubt</br>
            that it was the way to go. Your sunny dispositions, bright</br>
            smiles and caring demeanors helped at every appointment.</br>
            And the lovely gift certificate to Paul Labrecoue was</br>
            unnecessary but most appreciated. Many thanks to you all.

		    Dear Dr. Rosenthal,</br>
            I want to thank you for changing my life by giving me a smile</br>
            that gives me confidence and finally the ability to smile. I just</br>
            won two gigantic awards at my national meetings and had to</br>
            go on the stage and give a speech. I didn’t know I won ahead of</br>
            time so I had no idea I would have to do that. I am petrified on</br>
            stage but managed to do it thanks to my new smile. My short</br>
            off the cuff speech thanked a couple of people and then I said</br>
            that before this job I always thought I was a #2, my job allowed</br>
            me to set a goal, achieve it and win #1 for my sales in 2008. I</br>
            could not have done this without my smile. Thank you!
